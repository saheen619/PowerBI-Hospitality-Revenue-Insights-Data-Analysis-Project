# HOSPITALITY - REVENUE INSIGHTS - DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

To provide insights to the revenue team of a hotel business chain named AtliQ Hospitality. They own multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Holistic Hospitality is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 

As a strategic move, the managing director of Holistic Hospitality wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

You are a data analyst who has been provided with the data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following tasks:
• Create the metrics according to the metric list.
• Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
• Including WoW or MoM change for the KPIs / key Level report would be an added advantage.
• Include booking channel level splits for the KPIs
• Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
